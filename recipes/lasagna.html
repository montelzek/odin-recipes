        <p>
            Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well 
            worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and 
            step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go 
            over the basics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an 
            oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 
            25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. 
            Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature 
            for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
